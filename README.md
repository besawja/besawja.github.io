 My Github account is for learning purposes currently, trying to learn the ins and outs.
 The repository was the first of what I assume to be many created, there seems to be many tools and prompts available at my disposal.
 To clone the repository I had to first download the desktop version of Github, then link my account from my browser to the desktop application, then once the account was linked I was able to copy the repositry into a folder on my desktop.
